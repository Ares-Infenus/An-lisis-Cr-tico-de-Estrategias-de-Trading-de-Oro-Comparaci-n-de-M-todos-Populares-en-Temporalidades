I found a trading strategy that profited 225%   in just 100 trades. Which means it s 
one of the best trading strategies on   my channel so far. This is how you do it.
Go to the indicators tab and type in ema,   and click this one right here, but make sure 
you click it twice as we are going to need two.
  Go to the setting of one and change 
the length to 200 and make it blue.
  The go to the settings of the other ema and 
change the length to 50 and make it yellow.
  Next, we are going to need an 
indicator called trend meter. 
  Keep the settings at default, 
just uncheck this signals 1 box. 
  Then finally, we need a volatility oscillator. 
Here s the strategy.
  First, the yellow line (the 50 ema) must 
be above the blue line (the 200 ema).
  Next, we need 4 green dots and 2 
green lines on the trend meter.
  To confirm the signal we need bullish volatility 
in the market. So this white line need to be   heading upwards above this upper band. 
If all the rules are met, enter a trade. 
  Set your stop loss at the recent swing low, 
and you are going to exit the position once   you get a red dot on this top line.
So you would of exited here.
